# My portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! This repository serves as a central hub to showcase my various coding projects and accomplishments. Below, you'll find a list of my projects, each with a brief description and a link to its dedicated repository.

## Projects

[Phone Number Validator](https://github.com/aarcher19/Phone-Number-Validator)
This is a simple JavaScript application that validates phone numbers using regular expressions. It checks if the provided input is a valid US phone number and returns true or false accordingly.

[Roman Numeral Converter](https://github.com/aarcher19/Roman-Numeral-Converter)
This JavaScript project converts Roman numerals to decimal numbers.

[Palindrome Verify](https://github.com/aarcher19/Palindrome-Verify)
This JavaScript project checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not. It disregards non-alphanumeric characters and ignores case sensitivity during the verification.

[Caesar Cipher](https://github.com/aarcher19/Caesar-Cypher)
The Caesar Cipher is a JavaScript implementation of the famous encryption technique. It shifts the letters of the input string by a fixed number of positions to the right, effectively encrypting the message.

[Calculator](https://github.com/aarcher19/calculator)
This is a basic calculator application implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides standard calculator functionality, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

[Apple Clone](https://github.com/aarcher19/Apple-Clone)
This project is an Apple website clone that aims to replicate the appearance and functionality of the official Apple website. By mimicking the design and layout of the Apple website, this clone provides a demonstration of front-end web development skills, including HTML, and CSS.

[Product Label](https://github.com/aarcher19/Product-Label)
This HTML and CSS code represents a Supplement Facts label for a product. The label provides information about the serving size, nutritional content, and ingredients of the supplement. The design uses simple HTML elements and CSS styles to create a professional-looking label.

##Current Builds

[React To-Do App](https://github.com/aarcher19/React-To-Do-App)
